We will be designing a Shopping Bot that can search websites for products that match the user’s parameters, like item, price range, characteristics, as well as compare products between different sites.  We will utilize a web user interface that communicates with the user and a worker.  The worker’s main function will be to be the intermediary between a database and a web crawler. The web crawler, will search certain websites for these parameters, and we plan to build off of a template we can find online.  After, the worker will put these results into a database, which it will then access after all the searching is complete to compile and display user-friendly results on the web UI.
